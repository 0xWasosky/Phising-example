# Phising example 

## Why? 

I Wanted to make a clear example for how phising attacks can be performed, so i came up with this idea. 

## How to run it? 
Linux: 

- Donwload the repository using git: `git clone <repo-link>`
- Check if you have Python installed
- Create a venv: `python3.x -m venv .venv`
- Activate the venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install the requirements from requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the program: `python app.py`


  Disclamer the program is for educational purpose only !
